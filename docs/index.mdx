# Did you make that yourself?

Tell the world by adding the **not-slop.org** logo to your work!

It's not a certification or auditing system... just a fun way to show that you did your own homework.

# What is "slop"?

Generative AI can be very helpful. But there are important differences between human-authored content versus generative AI:

|                     | Human-authored                                                       | Generated                                                                                    |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Originality**     | Each author provides a unique viewpoint.                             | Viewpoints are generic, even across different LLM's.                                         |
| **Reputation**      | Authors have consistent credibility that can be judged from context. | An otherwise reliable output will randomly incorporate "hallucinations."                     |
| **Professionalism** | Writing style gives a clue to the author's diligence and expertise.  | High quality and poor quality content appear equally professional.                           |
| **Syndication**     | By supporting authors, we inspire them to keep creating. üèÖ          | What's the point of publishing generative content, if readers could just ask GPT themselves? |

AI content becomes **slop** when it gets mixed into a catalog of human-authored works. The painstakingly created human content drowns in a sea of great-looking but low-effort output.

# Make a statement

Adding the **not-slop.org** logo signifies that your project was _**completely authored**_ by real people, not generative AI.

The **not-slop.org** definition allows for reasonable electronic assistance:

- **Spell checkers & grammar checkers:** Okay to use, as long as they don't alter the original meaning in any way (for example, adding additional words).
- **Thesauruses:** Okay to use, as long as they only provide wording ideas, rather than automatically choosing words for you.
- **AI research tools:** While writing your content, it's okay for the human to ask questions or perform searches using an AI agent, provided the result is typed by hand, _not_ copy & pasted from a chatbot.
- **AI proofreading:** You can ask AI to look for mistakes or awkward language, as long as the fixes are not automatically applied. (Acceptable: _"Can you find any typos in this paragraph? List them."_ Unacceptable: _"Rewrite this paragraph to fix any mistakes."_)
- **AI translation services:** It's okay to translate your human-authored document into foreign languages, but you should ask a native speaker to review it.
- **Quoted AI excerpts:** For example, if you're writing an article about an AI chatbot, you can include transcripts of chats, as along as they're clearly separated from the main text.

# Where can I use it?

### Example HTML snippet

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

```html
<a href="https://not-slop.org"
  title="THIS CONTENT IS 100% HUMAN-AUTHORED."
